Regarding this code with a weird parenthesis at the end:

dense = keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(main_input)

(main_input): This part of the code is actually a function call. It's calling the dense layer with an input tensor main_input.
In a neural network, you have an input layer (usually the first layer) that receives the input data.
In this case, main_input is assumed to be the input tensor representing the input data.
